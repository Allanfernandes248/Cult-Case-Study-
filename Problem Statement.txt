As the Director of Product at cult.fit, My task is to conceptualize and design a dedicated social media platform for cult.fit's fitness community. This platform aims to enhance users' overall fitness experience by fostering connections, motivation, and socialization among like-minded individuals by promoting a positive and competitive environment.

The goal is to create a space where users can seamlessly connect with their gym buddies, workout partners, fellow sports enthusiasts, wellness companions, etc enabling them to share their fitness journeys, accomplishments, content, and progress. The platform should offer engaging features fostering a strong sense of community and well-being.

My role is to envision a user-centric and innovative social media platform that complements cult.fit's existing offerings and helps cultivate a thriving fitness-focused ecosystem.
